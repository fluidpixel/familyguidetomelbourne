The nautical themed playground at North Road Foreshore in Brighton is an excellent place to play, right on the seafront. Two large wooden boat structures dominate this small play area are a great change from the usual boring metal structures. The structures offer plenty of spaces to climb and play and combined with the quick slide and unique sprung boat make this a fun place to spend a few hours, especially for the imaginative little ones. It also offers the best view of the bay and Melbourne City of any playground we've visited.

There are a few downsides, there's no swings and the generous cover only covers the seating area, not the play zone. Lastly it needs a bit of repair, although it under consultation for an upgrade due in 2017, but a great fun park non-the-less.

There's a large cafe (North Point Cafe) and toilet block right across the road from the park and the bike path that passes next to the park is an ideal way of getting here.
