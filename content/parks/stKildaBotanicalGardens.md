The Botanical Gardens in St Kilda are a great way to spend the afternoon. The park is at one end, with a large veranda as a focal point. The swings, slides and climbing frames are a bit spread out, but means there's plenty of opportunity for running around and usually at least part of the park is shaded, even in the hottest part of the day.

The gardens themselves are immaculately maintained, with an large rose garden and greenhouses to explore as well as plenty of open space for picnics and lounging around. In addition there's a pond with a unique fountain and even a small stone carving of a temple from Japan hidden away in the trees. You can also try and find the large white parrots who have made these gardens their home up high in the large trees.

There aren't any cafes in the gardens, but Acland Street is just at one end, with it's endless options for eating and drinking, or Carlisle Street is only a short walk away with even more options.
