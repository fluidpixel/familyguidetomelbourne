A small park next to the National Theatre is fun for a quick stop off. There's a fairly large grass area popular with dog owners and sometimes used for keep fit groups. The park itself is compact, but with a slide, a baby and regular swings as well as a large climbing pyramid and a basketball hoop it will keep little ones entertained.

It's nearby to some great cafes, bus and tram services and not far at all from the delights of Acland Street.

However it's not the best maintained parks, sometimes with broken glass and liter around and unfortunately dog mess too. Don't let that put you off, it doesn't stop us going there, but it's a case of having a look around before letting them run free.
