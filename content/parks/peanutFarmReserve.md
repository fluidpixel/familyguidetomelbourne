Great park near to the beach and just behind the famous Acland Street. It's part of a larger Reserve in amongst residential properties. The play park itself has a variety of things to do, but aimed at the younger audience. A nice addition is a small wendy house in the middle of the park, with lots of potential for make-believe play.

Unfortunately there's no shade over the park itself, so not a good one for a sunny day, but there are plenty of trees around in the Reserve itself.

In addition to the park there's an outdoor workout area over the road, a basketball court, double sided tennis wall and a toilet block next to the cricket pitch.

There isn't any cafe in the immediate vicinity, but Acland street has everything you could need a short walk away, or towards the beach there's the famous [Rollo's Kiosk](http://www.rolloskiosk.com.au) next to the Skate Park.
