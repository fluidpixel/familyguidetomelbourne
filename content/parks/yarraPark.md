This fun park is in the shadow of Melbourne Cricket Ground just to the East of the city center. It's loosely sports themed, with a variety of climbing, hanging and balancing activities to try. The activities are suitable from young to older kids and include a unique balancing double swing, of which I've never seen before.

There's some shade from the surrounding trees as well as plenty of seating and tables around. A basketball net can be found next to the park.

Certainly a great park and a recommended visit if you're at the MCG for an event with little ones as it's only a few minutes walk north from the stadium.
