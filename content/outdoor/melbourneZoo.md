The zoo is great. If you're going to spend some time in Melbourne, get a yearly pass. It's well worth it.

It's large enough to easily spend a whole day here, with cafes and food of various types dotted around to keep you going and of course plenty of ice cream stops. They close the zoo at 5 but be warned some of the exhibits start to wind down a bit earlier, so don't leave seeing things to the last minute.

If the weather's really hot, some of the exhibits close to vistors and for some of the rest the animals hide away from the heat. Don't worry though, there's plenty to see so there will always be something on the move to entertain. Our favourites have been the penguins, giant tortoise, butterfly area and the lemur enclosure. Not forgetting the tigers, elephants, orangutangs and gorillas!

By the Lion enclosure there is a small water area with jets for the children to play in, which they'll love so bring swimming costumes. Just be warned there's no shade for them. Sadly as of Feb 17 there aren't any lions left at the zoo, we're hoping they can change that soon.

The Zoo is north of the city, a tram ride out is easiest, with the 55 stopping right next to the Zoo and will take about 30 minutes from the center.
