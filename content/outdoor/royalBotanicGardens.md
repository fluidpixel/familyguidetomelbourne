The Royal Botanic Gardens are an immaculately maintained free garden, with streams, forests, lakes and plenty of flora and forna.

There is a Children's Garden, but it's closed to the public on Monday and Tuesdays and apart from that there's not much to do for little ones outside running around and exploring.
