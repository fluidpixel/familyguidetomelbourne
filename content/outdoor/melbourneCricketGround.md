The MCG, the home of Cricket is a must visit venue in Melbourne. Hosting cricket, Australian Football League (AFL), live music and various other events throughout the year, there's always something on. MCG has one of the biggest stadium capacities in the world and has set a number of attendance records over the years. The atmosphere can be electric so for little ones ear defenders are a good idea.

There's plenty of seating, but the lower levels can be a bit more raucous. There's a family friendly area or the zone next to the hospitality area on level 2 is more sedate than the rest.

During match days they often put on activities for kids, including free face painting, bouncy castles and sport related games. There's also the Yarra Play Park nearby for an extra energy release for the younger ones. 

Food options around are limited around, but I'd recommend the Pie stand, it's both affordable and delicious and as a bonus they have donuts for afters. They do allow you to take your own food into the venue, but no glass bottles, cans or alcohol is allowed.
