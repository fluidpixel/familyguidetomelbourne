The Melbourne Museum is a great day out for the family. For toddlers to five year olds the stand-out activity will definitely be the Children's Gallery. Containing play areas, a rope climbing zone, interactive touch screens, an animated dance zone, building blocks and even a dinosaur bone dig based in a sand pit. I can guarantee there will be tears trying to get them away from here.

For the rest of the family the museum offers a mix of exhibits, including an excellent dinosaur and animal zone, a historical Aboriginal area, an alive rainforest and a human body exhibition. All in all it's easily a days worth of information if you do things properly, although we've been over a number of times and still not seen everything properly.

A yearly pass not only includes access here, but also to the Immigration Museum and ScienceWorks so is great value, even if you are just visiting the 3 venues.

There's an IMAX cinema attached to the museum, although the tickets are expensive and the shows limited, it could be good entertainment for the big kids.

Getting to the museum is easy, it's a short distance from the CBD and is very walkable, or has great tram and bus access, as well as being on the Melbourne Tour Bus Route. It's also in the grounds of Carlton Gardens, with a grand waterfall and plenty of open space to run around and let off some steam, or just chill with the possum that reside in the park.
