Boasting a 25m heated seawater pool alongside a lovely warm hydrotherapy pool this is great place to take the little ones on a rainy day. If you're feeling brave you can also take a dip in the sea during your session through the beachfront access.

We can also recommend the lessons that they offer from 6 months onwards, with the added benefit that joining the swimming classes gives you unlimited access to the pool for you and your little one.

For the adults there's a gym and a steam room, along with a selection of cafes and bars overlooking the sea outside.

There's a 'secret' public access roof-top terrace is a great space to chill and watch the world go by. The easiest access is via the lift next in the central corridor where you can find the swimming pool entrance.
