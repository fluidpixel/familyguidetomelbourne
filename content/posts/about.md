As a new family in the amazing city of Melbourne we wanted to explore all that the city has to offer for a young family. We are now documenting what we find and passing that information onto other families who are visiting or moving to Melbourne and the surrounding areas in Victoria.

We have a 2 year old daughter (22 months) so our opinions are biased to our situation, but where we can we've tried to keep in mind older or younger children when reviewing things to do.

The site is being updated all the time, so come back often to see the most up-to-date information.

If there's anything you want to see on the site then please let us know.

Stuart and Ruth.
